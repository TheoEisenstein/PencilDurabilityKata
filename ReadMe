Pencil Durability Kata
_________________________________________________________________

Simulate some functions of a pencil including, writing, becoming dull, sharpening, erasing, and editing. Utilize TDD to build.

For a more formal and in depth description, visit: https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-pencil-durability

At present there are only 22 test cases. There are a great many more that could be written to refine this work. A fun one to try, and a good one to revisit!



COMPILE/BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
_________________________________________________________________

**Instructions written from a windows command prompt perspective**

1) Open command prompt.

2) Navigate to where the PencilTest and Pencil file is located, wherever you unzipped or cloned the files.
  -Example: \Desktop\Kata\PencilKata\src\pencilKata


//Two *dependencies* to easily run the tests have been added to this location for your convenience.
//-hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
//-Add junit-4.12.jar

3) Enter this command:

javac -cp junit-4.12.jar;. PencilTest.java Pencil.java

  Result: .class files will be created

4) Enter this command

java -cp junit-4.12.jar;hamcrest-core-1.3.jar;. org.junit.runner.JUnitCore PencilTest

  Result: JUnit should spit out if the tests are failing or not. There is no user interface, just the satisfaction of tests passing.
